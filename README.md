# Postfix monitoring

This is the missing piece of software that cPanel have yet to add.
Created to detect malware / virus infected / hacked email accounts that attempt to use a legitimate email and send out spams.
It costed me multiple time, but biggest was USD 90+ on mailgun with 197k of spam emails being billed upon me.
I couldn't wait any longer. Please join me to maintain this :)

# How it works?

It scans /var/log/mail.log on interval basis, and logs all email activity being received from authenticated user.
Take note that it only support dovecot_plain at the moment. If you need other type of login, i may add it soon.

# How to operate?

Before starting, please go through this steps to limit the number of emails allowed per hour per domain.
